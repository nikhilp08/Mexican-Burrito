To make this recipe you will first need to butter both sides of the tortilla.

You will then need to put the tortilla on the pan until it is a little bit brown and warm. Then do the same for the other side of the tortilla.

After that take the tortilla off of the pan and put it on a plate.

Once you put it on a plate, put in the beans, cheese, and hot sauce.

You will then close both ends of the burrito.

Then you should put the burrito back on the pan and let it sit on one side until it is as crispy as you want it. Then do the same for the other side.

And that is how you make a Mexican Burrito.
